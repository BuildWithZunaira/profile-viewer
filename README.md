# profile-viewer(Flask App)
This is a simple Flask web application that allows users to search for profiles by selecting a username or by entering a maximum age to filter results. It uses Python with Flask for backend routing and logic, HTML and CSS for the frontend design, and Jinja2 templating to render dynamic user data. The user information is hardcoded in a dictionary, and different HTML templates are used to display individual profiles and filtered lists based on age.
